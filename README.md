# AnalyticsZooAutoML
This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook explaining how to set up and run Analytics Zoo experimental AutoML time series prediction on air quality and met data from Trondheim.

## Prerequisite
The description in the Notebook on how to set it up was done on an Ubuntu 18.04LTS virtual machine (but I guess it would run on other Linux distro as well.

## Documentation

Everything needed can be found in the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/arneme/AnalyticsZooAutoML/blob/master/AirQualityAnanlyticsZoo.ipynb)
